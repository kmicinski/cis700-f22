<h2 id="student-support">Student Support</h2>

<p>Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed
to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. There may be
aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in
barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I
invite any student to meet with me to discuss strategies and/or
accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be essential to your
success and to collaborate with the Office of Disability Services
(ODS) in this process.</p>

<p>If you would like to discuss disability-accommodations or register
with ODS, please visit their website at
http://disabilityservices.syr.edu. Please call (315) 443-4498 or email
disabilityservices@syr.edu for more detailed information.</p>

<p>ODS is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic
accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access
plan. Since academic accommodations may require early planning and
generally are not provided retroactively, please contact ODS as soon
as possible to begin this process.</p>

<h2 id="student-mental-health">Student Mental Health</h2>

<p>Mental health and overall well-being are significant predictors of
academic success. As such it is essential that during your college
experience you develop the skills and resources effectively to
navigate stress, anxiety, depression and other mental health
concerns. Please familiarize yourself with the range of resources the
Barnes Center provides (https://ese.syr.edu/bewell) and seek out
support for mental health concerns as needed. Counseling services are
available 24/7, 365 days a year, at 315.443.8000.</p>

<h2 id="discrimination-and-harassment">Discrimination and Harassment</h2>

<p>The University does not discriminate and prohibits harassment or
discrimination related to any protected category including creed,
ethnicity, citizenship, sexual orientation, national origin, sex,
gender, pregnancy, disability, marital status, age, race, color,
veteran status, military status, religion, sexual orientation,
domestic violence status, genetic information, gender identity, gender
expression or perceived gender.</p>

<p>Any complaint of discrimination or harassment related to any of these
protected bases should be reported to Sheila Johnson-Willis, the
Universitys Chief Equal Opportunity &amp; Title IX Officer. She is
responsible for coordinating compliance efforts under various laws
including Titles VI, VII, IX and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act. She can be contacted at Equal Opportunity, Inclusion, and
Resolution Services, 005 Steele Hall, Syracuse University, Syracuse,
NY 13244-1120; by email: titleix@syr.edu; or by telephone:

<p>If you notice any incidents of harassment or discrimination, however
minor, please email me. You may wish to use an anonymous email service
such as https://anonymousemail.me/. Please feel free to tell me as
much as you feel comfortable.  I am a mandatory Title IX reporter and
must report incidents such as sexual harassment, relationship
violence, stalking, etc…</p>
